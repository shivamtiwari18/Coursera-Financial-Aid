QUESTION 1) Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)

ANS) I am a Computer Science Student and am learning SRE from online portals like Coursera and other open-source portals. 
I have found this course and its content to be quite useful. Also, I am looking for a job in the SRE domain and so getting 
a certificate for this course would be quite helpful in showcasing the skills I have gained to a future potential recruiter.
However, given my current financial condition, I wouldnâ€™t be able to pay for the same. I am currently not employed and still 
in the process of building skills in the field to land a job. Thus, it will be difficult for me to pay for the course.
Thus, it is very difficult for my family right now to pay for this course.Hence, considering the current financial situation 
of my family, I request you to please grant me financial aid for this course, since this course would really help me in starting my career in SRE.

QESTION 2) How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals? 

ANS)I am looking to start a career in SRE and so am actively looking out for a Data Science internship/ entry-level role.
I am currently pursuing a number of online courses from various online platforms and am currently building my online portfolio.
This is one of the most important courses I am taking currently and one of the most crucial skill sets that I need to build to land 
an internship/ job. And, thus I need a course completion certificate to showcase the skillset I have gained through this course to 
a potential recruiter.This course also has quite detailed and practical assignments which will give me hands-on exposure to the 
exact skill set that I need to gain. There are very few online hands-on practical courses out there and this is one of them and so 
I do not want to miss out on learning from this one.Moreover, there are peer-reviewed assignments in every single module of the 
course which will give me varied perspectives on approaching the same problem and expand my learning horizon. Also, peers reviewing
my approach will help me track my progress in what aspects of the skillset I need to focus on and what concepts I need to put more work on.
All in all, this course is a great learning opportunity for me and will help me in getting my best foot forward and open doors for me in 
the SRE industry by landing my first SRE role.

enough to get paid courses, and we need a lot of free courses for learning and improving ourselves and help the humanity and society.
